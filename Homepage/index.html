													Mother squirrels are very dedicated and will try to retrieve their babies if separated from them.
													If the baby is <i>not injured*</i> or extremely skinny and you know where the nest is (and the mom is ok) the best
													thing for the baby is to try to reunite it with the mom.
												</li>
												<br />
												<li>
													Do not give it anything to eat or drink.  We want
													the baby to cry so that the mom will hear it.  Put the baby in a plastic dish (like for butter or cool whip)
													with a small piece of cloth (such as a piece of old t-shirt) under it and tack the dish to the tree where the
													nest is.  Put it at least 6 feet up from the ground.
												</li>
												<br />
												<ul>
													<li>Do not do this after dark! She will not come out after dark.</li>
													<li>Do not do this if the baby is injured.</li>
													<li>Do not do this if a cat has had it in its mouth.**</li>
												</ul>
												<br />
												<li>
													Go inside &amp; watch for the mom.  If she does not come for the baby within a couple of hours, please call us <b>(636) 677-3670.</b>
													If it is after dark, keep the baby warm overnight and put them out in the morning.  Place the container on a covered heating pad.
													Keep the heating pad on LOW.  Keep away from pets.  Put the container back out on the tree at first light and give mom an hour
													to come get it.
												</li>
												<br />
												<li>
													If, after an hour, the mom has not taken the babies back, please call our clinic.  The baby should be kept warm
													to the touch until you can bring it to us.
												</li>

											</ul>
											<br /><br />
											*If it is injured, has maggots, looks very skinny &amp; boney, or if it was brought to you by a dog or cat, please call the wildlife
											clinic.
											<br /><br />
											**If a cat got it, time is of the essence because the baby will need antibiotics.  Cat saliva is infectious and deadly.
											Call us!

												Bunnies are the babies most often unintentionally kidnapped by well-meaning people.  Rabbit nests are left unguarded most
												of the time, with the mother on the nest only twice a day for feeding.  Both feedings are done at night, when her presence will
												not attract predators.
											</li>
											<br>
											<li>
												Try to assess whether the babies seem warm, active, and have round tummies (bloated-looking) or if they are cold, thin,
												and dehydrated.  On bunnies that don't have much fur yet, you can see a white milk line in their tummy if they've been fed.
												If you think the nest is abandoned, place 4 pieces of string (dental floss works well) in an #(tic-tac-toe)-pattern across
												the nest and leave it overnight.  If it is disturbed in the morning, the mother has returned and the nest should be left alone.
												This method is only trustworthy if the babies eyes are not yet open.  If their eyes are open and they are getting bigger they
												may be coming out of the nest during the day and returning at night.
											</li>
											<br>
											<li>
												If the nest has not been disturbed, check the babies to see if their bellies look full and round.  If not, keep them warm,
												do not feed and call WRC
											</li>
											<br>
											<li>
												If the nest is poorly located, cut the grass around it or cover with something that will allow the mother to get to them,
												but not predators (Put an upside-down wheelbarrow or a lawnmower over the nest.)  If it really bothers you not to mow there,
												you could gently take them out mow over it and put them back in EXACTLY the same location, but make sure they still have their
												fur and dried grasses to cover them.  Yes, mom will still accept her babies if they've been touched by humans, but don't handle
												more than absolutely necessary!  The babies are fragile and easily stressed so don't let the whole family or neighborhood hold them.
												They need peace and quiet.  It won't be inconvenient for long, the babies usually leave the nest at only 2-3 weeks of age.  Never try to move the nest!
												Mom doesn't find them by smell, she knows where they are geographically and even a 2-foot difference can throw her off.
											</li>
											<br>
											<li>
												Whatever the situation, if you feel they are compromised, please give us a call and we can help you assess the situation.
												However, please do all you can to keep the babies with their mother. Rabbit mothers are much better at raising them than humans are.

												Mother skunks usually create a den under a porch, driveway, deck, or underground. The mother will venture out each evening
												to find food for herself, and return near dawn each morning. Skunks do not make noises of any sort to alert anyone if they are
												injured or abandoned. If you find baby skunks outside of their den, or starting to come out during day time hours and you are
												aware of a dead skunk nearby (via smell or sight) please call us. If we cannot be immediately reached, you can temporarily
												house the babies until we return your call.
											</li>
											<br>
											<li>
												If baby skunks have their eyes open already, they <b>CAN</b> and <b>MAY</b> spray but only in tiny quantities that are not
												usually bothersome. When picking up a baby skunk, try to keep the tail tucked under the body so they are less able to spray.
												Place the babies in a shoebox or other cardboard box, on a towel or pillowcase and keep in a warm, dark, quiet area in your
												home or garage until we return your call. You can make a homemade heat source using a sock and some rice if possible. Fill a
												sock with rice, tie off the end, microwave for one minute and place in box. If babies are cold, they will cling to it, if babies
												are not cold, they will ignore it. Do NOT place rice sock directly on babies.
											</li>
											<br>
											<li>
												If you are unaware of any dead skunks in your vicinity, the babies can be placed back outside near the den site in the box
												provided. Place a towel or blanket over the box to keep predatory eyes off of them and await Momma Skunk's return. If the babies
												have not been retrieved in a few hours, please bring them back in and call us.
											</li>
											<br>
											<li>
												*If babies have maggots, fly packets, is in *any* way visibly injured, dehydrated, bloated, or bleeding in any way, do not
												attempt to reunite and call us immediately.
											</li>
											<br>
											<li>*If babies have been handled by a cat or dog, please do not attempt to reunite and call us immediately.</li>
											<br />
											<li>
												<b><u>*DO NOT FEED. DO NOT GIVE ANYTHING TO DRINK.</u></b> SKUNK FORMULAS ARE VERY SPECIFIC TO SKUNKS. THEY CANNOT DIGEST
												GOAT OR COW'S MILK on a long term basis and SHOULD <b>NEVER</b> BE FED MEAT OR DOG OR CAT FOOD, EVEN CANNED. These foods seem
												effective at first, but ultimately will kill these animals if not corrected quickly with the proper diet.
