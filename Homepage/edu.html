				<button class="collapsibleFAQ">If I find a wild animal in distress what should I do?</button>
				<div class="contentFAQ">
					<p>Safely contain the animal. Put the animal in a warm, dark, quiet place and immediately contact us</p>
				</div>
				<button class="collapsibleFAQ">What to I do if I find a wild rabbit?</button>
				<div class="contentFAQ">
					<p style="text-align:justify">
						If the babies’ eyes are still closed, they are under 10 days of age. If the nest is intact, if the babies
						look plump and are nestled snuggly next to each other, if there seems to be no immediate danger to them,
						then leave them alone! You can check to see if the mother rabbit is coming back by crisscrossing the nest
						with two or three strands of dental floss or thin string. If the string is pushed back out of the way in the morning,
						then you know that the mother has returned to her babies. If, after 24 hours, the string is still in place, then it is
						time locate emergency care for those babies (see below).
						<br /><br />
						The mother will not abandon her babies just because the scent of a human is on them. If you are doubtful, then wash
						your hands and rub them in the grass and soil around the nest and gently replace the babies, making the nest up as
						it was before you disturbed it. Leave the site as soon as possible. They can easily die of stress and fright — right
						now or later on. Please do not pick them up unless you are very sure they are orphans or if they are injured (see below).
						<br /><br />
						If a wild rabbit is brought to you by a cat or dog, it is in great danger.  The saliva of a cat carries life-threatening
						bacteria and a bunny that has been in the mouth of a cat usually dies if not given antibiotics within 8 hours of the attack.
						Puncture marks are often nearly invisible, so don’t rely on a visual once-over to assess damage. Moreover, even if there
						appears to be no external wound, the teeth of a cat or dog may have easily crushed a vital internal organ. Get the baby to
						a wildlife rehabilitator right away. Also, please monitor your pets. Keep your cats indoors and watch your dog during baby
						bunny season. Take periodic walks through your yard to make sure there are no nests your pet can disturb.
						<br /><br />
						If the nest has been destroyed by you, a lawnmower, dog, etc., you can actually recreate a nest for the babies on or a few
						feet away from the original nest site. Gather dried grasses and scoop out a similar shallow form in the earth. Replace the
						dried grasses and bits of rabbit fur (the mother always pulls fur from her chest and abdomen to line the nest for her babies).
						Rub your hands in the grass and soil around the nest and gently replace the babies. Do not move the nest more than a few feet
						from the original site because the mother might not be able to find it again.
						<br /><br />
						Do NOT attempt to feed a baby rabbit—they should not drink water, milk, Pedialyte etc.  Baby rabbits are incredibly fragile
						and do not take handling by humans well at all. Keep wild rabbits away from children, household noise (such as vacuum cleaner
						and so forth), domestic pets and bright light. Do not carry the rabbits around or show them to your friends, etc. A rabbit
						that seems “calm” is usually too scared to move or is in shock as a result of trauma (cat, dog, lawnmower, or even simply being
						picked up from its nest). Wild rabbits do not know you are just trying to help. They think you are going to kill them. This
						fear, as well as improper feeding/rehydration, will make their stomachs shut down, which will lead to an extremely protracted,
						painful, and unnecessary death.
						<br /><br />
						IF any of the following are true:

						<ul>
							<li>The nest cannot be reestablished or</li>
							<li>The babies are in imminent life-threatening danger or</li>
							<li>There is no sign of the mother (at least over 24 to 48 hours) or</li>
							<li>The babies are injured</li>
							<li>THEN contact CWC right away.</li>
						</ul>

				<button class="collapsibleFAQ">Are there animals that Wildlife Rehabilitation Clinic will not accept?</button>
				<div class="contentFAQ">
					<p style="text-align:justify">
						We care for squirrels, opossums, raccoons, rabbits, and skunks. <br />
						We do not accept domestic pets, deer, birds, or reptiles
					</p>
				</div>
				<button class="collapsibleFAQ">Why can't I keep the wildlife I that I find?</button>
				<div class="contentFAQ">
					<p style="justify-content">
						It is illegal to possess wildlife unless you have a permit or are a licensed
						wildlife rehabilitator. Almost all native and migratory birds, mammals and
						reptiles are protected by specific state and federal laws put in place to protect
						wildlife and ensure that wild animals receive appropriate, adequate, species-specific
						care when they are sick, injured or orphaned. The ultimate goal of wildlife rehabilitation
						is to release an animal back to the wild.
					</p>
				</div>
				<button class="collapsibleFAQ">I found an orphan baby animal. What should I do?</button>
				<div class="contentFAQ">
					<p style="text-align:justify">
						If you find a baby wild animal, it is best to leave it alone.
						Many mammals such as deer and rabbits leave their young unattended for extensive periods of time.
						Only State Certified Wildlife Rehabilitators are legally allowed to possess native wildlife species
						including mammals, birds, amphibians and reptiles. Improper care of wild animals by well meaning,
						untrained individuals yields either imprinted wild animals (animals that cannot be released back
						into the wild) or animals that have nutritional issues resulting in life-long health issues.
						Inexperienced caregivers also risk serious health problems due to disease and parasite transmission
						from wild animals.
					</p>
				</div>
				<button class="collapsibleFAQ">What time of the year is best to trim trees and bushes?</button>
				<div class="contentFAQ">
					<p style="text-align:justify">
						Play it safe and trim in the LATE FALL & EARLY WINTER.
						Nesting season is usually complete by November.
					</p>
				</div>
				<button class="collapsibleFAQ">Will you release an animal back to where I found it?</button>
				<div class="contentFAQ">
					<p style="text-align:justify">
						Sometimes it is important to release animals back to their
						own territory, but other times it is not essential. Wildlife Rehabilitaion Clinic staff will
						consider an animal’s individual case and make this determination at the time of release.
						In each case, it is important that we know where the animal was found and what the circumstances
						of the injury were at its time of admittance.
					</p>
				</div>
				<button class="collapsibleFAQ">Can I see Wildlife Rehabilitation Center's patients?</button>
				<div class="contentFAQ">
					<p style="text-align:justify">
						Yes! Every Fall and Spring we open our doors to the public. We also have fun games for
						kids to play, face painting, gift shop, food, and an education table.
					</p>
				</div>
				<button class="collapsibleFAQ">Will someone call me to tell me how the animal I found is doing?</button>
				<div class="contentFAQ">
					<p style="text-align:justify">
						We do not personally call individuals who bring animals in because we are so busy,
						but we do encourage you to call us to find out how the animal is doing.
					</p>
				</div>
				<button class="collapsibleFAQ">How is Wildlife Rehabilitation Clinic funded?</button>
				<div class="contentFAQ">
