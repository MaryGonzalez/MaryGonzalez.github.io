			The Wildlife Rehabilitation Clinic is an all-volunteer, non-profit 501(c)3 organization which specializes in the rehabilitation
			of native Missouri mammals and is licensed by the Missouri Department of Conservation.
			<br /><br />Founded in 1989, we are firmly committed
			to providing top-notch care for the animals in our care and are very proud of a release rate well above the national average.
			<br /><br />Our primary purpose is to care for injured and orphaned wildlife with successful release back into its natural habitat. We
			provide food, shelter and rehabilitative care for the animals in our facility and provide them with an opportunity to develop
			and recover in an environment that is reasonably natural for them, before returning them to the wild.
			<br /><br />Wildlife Rehabilitation
			Clinic cares for hundreds of animals each year. We are not funded by any government agencies.
			<i> We receive 100% of our funding from private donations. </i>

											Jason Rose is a graduate of Western Illinois University with a degree in Recreation,
											Parks, and Tourism. He works as a Program Manager at Wyman Center. His job requires
											him to live on site at Camp Wyman in Eureka, MO. A typical day of work for Jason can
											send him up on a high ropes course in the morning and a local corporation for
											teambuilding in the afternoon. He shares his home with a variety of different scaly
											and furry animals. He has always been passionate about wildlife and he can often be
											found in the woods hiking and exploring. In his free time away from the clinic and
											work Jason is often out on a local river in a canoe or up north in Minnesota on
											extended wilderness trips. He has been a volunteer at WRC since October 2010 and he
											was very excited to be part of the Board of Directors starting in 2012 and beyond.

											Julie was born in the small, rural town of Clinton, Missouri. Her parents believed
											in teaching their five children to appreciate nature; to love and nurture it. As a
											result, there were always plenty of animals around the house, including geese,
											chickens, pigeons, quail (her father had a breeder's permit to help restore the quail
											population in central Missouri), a very smart crow, snakes, tarantulas, scorpions, a
											caiman (which is a small crocodile), tortoises, dogs, cats and many more. Julie married
											Vince in 1987 and moved to St. Louis. They have two daughters. Since 2001, volunteering
											at the Wildlife Rehabilitation Clinic has allowed Julie to enjoy the things she loved
											most about her childhood: Working with animals. Julie has a lifetime certification in
											elementary education from the University of Missouri, Columbia. She enjoys teaching
											people of all ages the value of conservation and how to live in harmony with the plants
											and animals that make up this beautiful planet. Julie loves spending time with her family,
											playing with her dog, Bella, watching the crazy antics of her two pet mice, and gardening,
											hiking, traveling, reading and archaeology.
